# UnderEngineeredCalculator
A calculator demo. "But its also missing code, so it injects what its missing"

The idea came from a discussion about writing the most obfuscated calculator.

+ Only 4 operations supported. (`Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiply`, `Divide`)
+ No decimal / floating point / parentheses support. (Integers only)
